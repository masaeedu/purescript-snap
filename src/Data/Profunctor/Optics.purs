-- Ok, so we want to show that "monomorphic" traversals are equivalent to profunctor
-- optics with the MonoidalMono constraint. If we can show that, it proves that with
-- a little bit of legwork, the stuff in the existing lens library can be generalized
-- so that we can just take any Traversal' and apply it to an arbitrary component.

-- For example if you have a `traverseArray :: forall a. Traversal' [a] a`, you should
-- be able to take some `todo :: Component' m JSX Todo` and just do:
-- ```
-- todos :: Component m JSX [Todo]
-- todos = traverseArray todo
-- ```

-- Now we're going to do this in "easy mode", i.e. we're going to ignore the fact that all
-- the actual traversals in the lens library are in terms of `Wander` and not in terms of
-- `Monoidal` at all. There's some relationship between the two it seems like, but precisely
-- what it is is an open research problem.
--
-- We just ignore this bullshit and assume all the profunctor traversals are going to be written
-- using the appropriate `Monoidal`-like constraints and all the concrete traversals are going
-- to be written using the `LTraversal` thing below (instead of the `Star a b -> Star s t` form
-- it takes in the Haskell lens library).
--
-- The idea is that we're going to relate `MonoidalMono` and `LTraversalMono` (and show that there's
-- a bunch of useful `LTraversalMono`s that we can write, which in `MonoidalMono` form conveniently
-- interact with our components. Then we just do a handwave and say there's *some* analogous relationship
-- between a monomorphized `Traversal` from the Haskell lens library and some specialization of `Wander`
-- like `WanderMono` or something. Those are what you'd want to use for efficiency, figuring those out
-- is left as a future exercise.
--
-- Presumably profunctors for which we can implement `MonoidalMono` also support this hypothetical
-- `WanderMono` (specifically our components do hopefully), although what the relationship between
-- `MonoidalMono` and `WanderMono` is remains a mystery until we know what the relationship between
-- `Monoidal` and `Wander` is.

-- TODO: Move this somewhere else

-- Concrete traversals (a substitute for the Haskell library version of concrete traversals)
type LTraversal s t a b = { contents :: s -> L.List a, fill :: L.List b -> s -> t }

-- Profunctor traversals
type PTraversal s t a b = forall p. Monoidal p => Lazy2 p => p a b -> p s t -- We need the lazy because recursing in purescript is dumb
type PTraversal' s a = PTraversal s s a a

-- Specialization of concrete traversals where t = s and b = a
type LMonoTraversal s a = LTraversal s s a a

-- Specialization of profunctor traversals where t = s and b = a
type PMonoTraversal s a = forall p. MonoidalMono p => Lazy2 p => p a a -> p s s -- Ditto re: lazy

-- A good intuition for the concrete traversal presentation above is
-- to note that it's isomorphic to a function `s -> FunList a b t`,
-- where `FunList` is the type elaborated below. We're not going to
-- actually work with the `FunList` representation, but it's good to
-- see a slightly different equivalent presentation of the concrete
-- traversals to get a feel for what they're actually doing.

-- It's also important to work through this isomorphism because in the
-- profunctor optics paper they actually just use `s -> FunList a b t`
-- directly as the representation of concrete optics. So while we're
-- using a slightly different representation, running the concrete optic
-- end of our isomorphisms between concrete and profunctor optics through
-- this isomorphism should give us the concrete <-> profunctor isomorphisms
-- that the paper has.

-- This paper btw: http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jeremy.gibbons/publications/poptics.pdf

-- A `FunList` consists of some number of `a` values, and a function
-- that converts an equal number of `b` values to a `t`
--
-- | NB:
-- | Really we need typed vectors here, i.e. the representation should be something like:
-- |
-- | ```
-- | data FunList a b t where
-- |   FunList :: forall (n :: Nat). Vec n a -> (Vec n b -> t) -> FunList a b t
-- | ```
-- |
-- | but I don't feel like fighting the PureScript compiler over this, so fuck it.

fl2lt f = { contents, fill }
  where
  contents s = runFunList (f s) const
  fill bs s = runFunList (f s) (\_ o -> o bs)

-- Ok, so now we try to prove that there are isomorphisms between:
-- 1. `LTraversal s t a b` <-> `PTraversal s t a b`
-- 2. `LTraversalMono s a` <-> `PTraversalMono s a`

-- The second one is the only one that's applicable for our poor `Component`s, because
-- they can't implement the first one. It's good to show the isomorphism for both the
-- general version and the specialized version though.

-- Alright, here's the forward direction for 1...

  uncons (L.Cons a as) = Left (Tuple a as)
  cons = uncurry L.Cons
  dup a = Tuple a a
  merge = either identity identity

-- And the forward direction for 2...
--
-- | NB:
-- | This is basically an exact duplicate of the definition above, the only thing that is
-- | different is that we're using the weaker MonoidalMono constraint, and therefore use
-- | zipMono in the definition below. That also demands that the types be less flexible;
-- | we only have two degrees of freedom now.
-- |
-- | There has *got* to be a way to do this less shittily, but for now copy paste works,
-- | brain not work good at 4 AM
